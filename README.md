# Pig-Dice-Game
The game has 2 players playing in turns. In each turn, a player can roll the dice as many times as he want unless encountered by '1'. Each number on the dice is added to his round score. But if the player rolls a '1', all his round score becomes null. After that it's the next player's turn. The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his round score gets added to his global score before encoutering '1' on the dice. The first player to reach 50 points on global score wins the game.
